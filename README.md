# GDI Intro to Redux - Count Reducer Practice

## Set up locally
If you have not yet, [install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidrf/gdi-intro-to-redux-count-reducer.git
$ cd gdi-intro-to-redux-count-reducer
$ yarn install
```

## Working through the tests

To run the tests, you can do

```
$ yarn test
```

Work through the following test files in order and change `xdescribe` to `describe` and `xit` to `it` as you work down the file.
1. `src/__tests__/1_countActionCreators.js`
2. `src/__tests__/2_countReducer.js`
3. `src/__tests__/3_store.js`

The first two test suites will require you to change `src/count.js` for them to pass.
